**Type**: `Boolean`.

**Default Value**: `false`.

When set to `true`, all HTML files and Serverless Functions will have their extension removed. When visiting a path that ends with the extension, a 308 response will redirect the client to the extensionless path.

For example, a static file named `about.html` will be served when visiting the `/about` path. Visiting `/about.html` will redirect to `/about`.

Similarly, a Serverless Function named `api/user.go` will be served when visiting `/api/user`. Visiting `/api/user.go` will redirect to `/api/user`.
