**Type**: `Boolean`.

**Default Value**: `undefined`.

### false

When `trailingSlash: false`, visiting a path that ends with a forward slash will respond with a 308 status code and redirect to the path without the trailing slash.

For example, the `/about/` path will redirect to `/about`.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "trailingSlash": false
}`}</Code>

### true

When `trailingSlash: true`, visiting a path that does not end with a forward slash will respond with a 308 status code and redirect to the path with a trailing slash.

For example, the `/about` path will redirect to `/about/`.

However, paths with a file extension will not redirect to a trailing slash.

For example, the `/about/styles.css` path will not redirect, but the `/about/styles` path will redirect to `/about/styles/`.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "trailingSlash": true
}`}</Code>

### undefined

When `trailingSlash: undefined`, visiting a path with or without a trailing slash will not redirect.

For example, both `/about` and `/about/` will serve the same content without redirecting.

This is not recommended because it could lead to search engines indexing two different pages with duplicate content.
