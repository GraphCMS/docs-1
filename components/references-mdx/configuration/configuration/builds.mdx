**Type:** `Array` of build `Object`.

**Valid values:** a list of build descriptions whose `src` references valid source files.

**Build object definition:**

- `src` (`String`): A glob expression or pathname. If more than one file is resolved, one build will be created per matched file. It can include `*` and `**`.
- `use` (`String`): An npm module to be installed by the [build process](/docs/v2/advanced/builders). It can include a semver compatible version (e.g.: `@org/proj@1`).
- `config` (`Object`): Optionally, an object including arbitrary metadata to be passed to the Builder.

<P>
  The following will include all HTML files as-is (to be served statically), and
  build all Python files and JS files into{' '}

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "*.html", "use": "@now/static" },
    { "src": "*.py", "use": "@now/python" },
    { "src": "*.js", "use": "@now/node" }
  ]
}`}</Code>

<Note>
  When at least one <InlineCode>builds</InlineCode> item is specified, only the
  outputs of the build processes will be included in the resulting deployment as
  a security precaution. This is why we need to white-list static files
  explicitly with
  <InlineCode>@now/static</InlineCode>.
