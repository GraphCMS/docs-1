[Userbase](https://userbase.com/) is the easiest way to add user accounts and data persistence to your static site.
All Userbase features are accessible through a very simple [JavaScript SDK](https://userbase.com/docs/sdk/), directly from the browser without a backend.
This guide walks through building a Todo app with Userbase and Next.js.

## Step 1: Create A Userbase Account

First you'll need to create a Userbase account if you don't already have one. You can create one in _less than 10 seconds_ [here](https://v1.userbase.com/#create-admin).

After creating your account, make note of your _App Id_. We'll store it later as an environment variable for our project.

## Step 2: Set Up A New Next.js Project

Let's start off by scaffolding a Next.js project with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quick styling.

<Snippet dark text="npm init next-app --example with-tailwindcss next-userbase && cd next-userbase" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js + Tailwind app and entering the new project directory</Caption>

Then we'll add the `userbase-js` dependency to our project.

<Snippet dark text="npm install userbase-js" />
<Caption>Installing the userbase dependency</Caption>

## Step 3: Deploy A Preview and Link Your Project

Although we haven't done anything with our app yet, its a great time to configure our project settings and deploy a preview. With the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download), we can
configure project settings and deploy with a single command.

<Snippet dark text="now" />
<Caption>Configure project settings and deploy</Caption>

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables

We will find our newly created project in the Vercel dashboard and can now navigate to the project settings to add our Userbase _app id_ from earlier as
an [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables).

With the Userbase trial account, we are only given a single _app id_, so we can set the same value for Development, Preview, and Production for now.

Lets add our _app id_ under the `USERBASE_APP_ID` variable for all of our environments.

  ${process.env.ASSETS}/guides/deploying-userbase-with-vercel/env-vars.png
`}
  width={753}
  height={594}

<Caption>

</Caption>

Now that we have our _app id_ set across each of our environments. We can securely use them during development
by running `now env pull` from our project root.

<Snippet dark text="now env pull" />
<Caption>Pulling development environment variables via the Vercel CLI.</Caption>

Running the command above will automatically create a `.env` variable which our local Next.js dev server can read from.

The last thing we need to do before we can jump into the code, will be to create a `next.config.js` file that makes the environment variable
available throughout our app.

<Code lang="js">
  {`
    module.exports = {
      env: {
        USERBASE_APP_ID: process.env.USERBASE_APP_ID,
      },
    };
`}
</Code>
<Caption>Add `USERBASE_APP_ID` environment variable to next.config.js</Caption>

## Step 5: Write the App

### Global Styles

First, let's add some global button styles in a `button.css` file within the `styles` directory in the project root. We are composing classes with Tailwind's [apply directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components#extracting-css-components-with-apply).

<Code lang="js">{ButtonStyles}</Code>
<Caption>Global button styles defined in `styles/button.css`</Caption>

We then import our button styles in our main stylesheet.

<Code lang="js">{IndexCSS}</Code>
<Caption>Importing `button.css` in `styles/index.css`</Caption>

### Application Root

Let's initialize our application with some global state for the user and also let's create
an effect to start up Userbase.

Your `_app.js` should look like the following:

<Code lang="js">{AppJs}</Code>
<Caption>`_app.js` file that initializes Userbase, sets up global state, and passes down props to {`<Layout />`} component </Caption>

### Layout Component

Then we'll create a `<Layout />` component to wrap our pages with a few Tailwind classes and a `<Nav />` component, which we pass down our user state and updater function props to.

<Code lang="js">{Layout}</Code>
<Caption>{`<Layout />`} component in `components/layout.js`</Caption>

### Nav Component

Next, we create the `<Nav />` component where we add two buttons for opening a modal that allows you to log in to an existing account or sign up for a new one.

<Code lang="js">{Nav}</Code>
<Caption>{`<Nav />`} component in `components/nav.js`</Caption>

### Modal Component

Next, we create the `<LoginModal />` form that allows us to log in or sign up in.

<Code lang="js">{Modal}</Code>
<Caption>{`<LoginModal />`} component in `components/modal.js`</Caption>

### TodoForm Component

Finally, the last component we'll create is the actual Todo form.

<Code lang="js">{TodoForm}</Code>
<Caption>{`<TodoForm />`} component in `components/todo-form.js`</Caption>

### Home Page

We tie it all up together by rendering our `<TodoForm />` in our home page.

<Code lang="js">{HomePage}</Code>
<Caption>Home page in `pages/index.js` rendering {`<TodoForm />`}</Caption>

## Step 6: Deploying To Production

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
