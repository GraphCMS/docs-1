[Userbase](https://userbase.com/) is the easiest way to add user accounts and data persistence to your static site.
All Userbase features are accessible through a very simple [JavaScript SDK](https://userbase.com/docs/sdk/), directly from the browser without a backend.
This guide walks through building a Todo app with Userbase and Next.js.

## Step 1: Create A Userbase Account

First you'll need to create a Userbase account if you don't already have one. You can create one in _less than 10 seconds_ [here](https://v1.userbase.com/#create-admin).

After creating your account, make note of your _App ID_. We'll store it later as an environment variable for our project.

## Step 2: Set Up A New Next.js Project

Let's start off by scaffolding a Next.js `with-userbase` template from the [Next.js Examples Directory](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-userbase)

<Snippet dark text="npm init next-app --example with-userbase userbase-todo-app && cd userbase-todo-app" />
<Caption>Initializing a Next.js + Userbase app and entering the new project directory</Caption>

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables

The scaffolded template expects us to provide a `USERBASE_APP_ID` variable as shown in `next.config.js`.

<Code lang="js">
  {`
    module.exports = {
      env: {
        USERBASE_APP_ID: process.env.USERBASE_APP_ID,
      },
    };
`}
</Code>
<Caption>`USERBASE_APP_ID` environment variable in next.config.js</Caption>

For development, you can simply add your Userbase _App ID_ from _Step 1_ as an environment variable in a `.env` file in your project root and run `next dev` to start a development server.

<Code lang="bash">
  {`USERBASE_APP_ID=<paste-your-id-here>`}
</Code>
<Caption>`USERBASE_APP_ID` environment variable defined in .env</Caption>

In order to take your app to production, you can add the _App ID_ as a secret by running the following command:

<Snippet dark text="now secrets add userbase-app-id [paste-your-id-here]" />
<Caption>Adding a secret to your Vercel account. Make sure to remove the brackets.</Caption>

Our template already provides us with a `now.json` that makes use of the secret we added above.

<Code lang="json">
  {`
    {
      "build": {
        "env": {
          USERBASE_APP_ID: "@userbase-app-id"
        }
      }
    }
  `}
</Code>
<Caption>`now.json` reading our secret as a build environment variable</Caption>

## Step 4: Deploying To Production

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
