By default, the Vercel platform blocks outgoing SMTP connections. This is for security reasons, to prevent malicious use of the platform.

As a result of this, it is not possible to use SMTP clients such as [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) to send email from [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction).

## Sending Email

To send email from Serverless Functions, we recommend the use of a third-party mail service and have provided examples of these below:

- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).
- [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).
- [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/).

By using a third-party mail service, you will be able to send email from Serverless Functions. You will also benefit from analytics, scheduling, and many other features not available when using an SMTP client.
